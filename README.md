### crud operations with ASP.NET using C# basics, database connections with mysql server, Linq

<br>

This is the first ASP.NET Core Web API application I tried.
From this appication, I wanted to cover basics of writing APIs and use concepts in C# , .net and Linq

here are the things I tried to learn and apply here:
  - Basic CRUD with .net
  - In memory database with EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
  - Switching connection to MySQL Server
  - using Migrations
  - use Asyncronus Communication (async - await)
  - Routing 
  - use Generics provided by .net framework to my APIs
  - output status codes
  
  C#
  - variables, Lists, etc. 
  - DateTime
  - Conditions & Loops
  - Enums
  - Exeptions
  - Linq
